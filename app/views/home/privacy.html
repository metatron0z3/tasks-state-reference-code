  <h1>Our Privacy Principles</h1>

  <p>The most fundamental privacy principle we follow is that by default, anything you post to Troop is private to your team. That is, viewing the messages and files shared within a specific team requires authentication as a member of that team.</p>
  <p>Troop is the custodian of data on behalf of the teams that use Troop. We don’t own team communication data. Teams own their data. They like it that way and so do we.</p>
  <p>At Troop we believe that more transparency is better than less. We try to make our product easy to use, with settings and options that are easy to find and understand. This is good for privacy, good for the product, and good for Troop customers and users.</p>
  <p>Privacy goes hand in glove with security and confidentiality. We see these things being the three legs that keep the stool balanced and upright. Each is as important as the other and if one is missing the stool won’t stand. They are all very important to us and we take them very seriously.</p>
  <p>Troop Privacy Policy</p>
  <p>Updated: Sep 7, 2016</p>
  <p>This privacy policy is here to help you understand what information we collect at Troop, how we use it, and what choices you have. When we talk about Troop in this policy, we are talking about Troop., the company, Troop, the downloadable application, and the Troop website at <a href="https://troopwork.com" target="_blank">https://troopwork.com</a>. Troop is available for use via a web browser or applications specific to your desktop or mobile device.</p>
  <p>This policy describes how Troop treats your information, not how other organizations treat your information. If you are using Troop in a workplace or on a device or account issued to you by your employer or another organization, that company or organization likely has its own policies regarding storage, access, modification, deletion, and retention of communications and content which may apply to your use of Troop. Content that would otherwise be considered private to you or to a limited group of people may, in some cases, be accessible by your Team Owner or administrator. Please check with your employer, Team Owner or administrator about the policies it has in place regarding your communications and related content on Troop. More on this below.</p>
  <p>In this policy we talk about various roles within a Troop team and the privileges that come with each. It’s helpful to understand these roles and the relationships between them. Here’s the breakdown: primary owner &gt; Troop Administrator &gt; Troop member. Primary owners have the most control over their team’s settings on Troop, followed by Troop Administrators. The person who establishes the Troop team is considered the primary owner with the most control over the troop (which is why it’s not a good idea for this person to be a contractor or temp employee). Troop can have more than one owner, but only one can be the primary owner. Primary ownership can be transferred to another member after the team is created. All Team Owners are administrators, and all owners and administrators are also troop members.</p>
  <p>Information We Collect and Receive</p>
  <p>Account and profile information. The only information we require to create your Troop account is a mobile phone number, a password and a first and last name.</p>
  <p>Troop-level Information. When you create Troop we collect a Troop name and, optionally, a Troop level description.</p>
  <p>Log data. When you use Troop, our servers automatically record information, including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or your mobile app sends when you’re using it. This log data may include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web page you visited before coming to Troop, your browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, information about your browser configuration and plug-ins, language preferences, and cookie data. Log data does not contain message content and is not routinely deleted.</p>
  <p>Device information. In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device you’re using Troop on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you’re using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings.</p>
  <p>Geo-location information. Precise GPS from mobile devices is collected only with your permission. WiFi and IP addresses received from your browser or device may be used to determine approximate location.</p>
  <p>Troop usage information. This is information about which troops, boards, cards and members you interact with within Troop.</p>
  <p>Communication content that you send and receive within Troop. This includes: The message content itself (messages, pictures, files and video among other types of files) and when messages or files were sent and by whom, when or if they were seen by you, and where you received them (in a board or direct message, for example).</p>
  <p>Information from partners or other 3rd parties. Troop may receive information from partners or others that we could use to make our own information better or more useful. This might be aggregate level information about which IP addresses go with which zip codes or it might be more specific information about how well an online marketing or email campaign performed.</p>
  <p>How we use your information</p>
  <p>We use your information for the following:</p>
  <p>Providing the Troop service. We use information you provide to authenticate you and deliver message content to you and from you</p>
  <p>Understanding and improving our products. To make the product better we have to understand how users are using it. We have a fair bit of data about usage and we intend to use it many different ways to improve our products, including research. This policy is not intended to place any limits on what we do with usage data that is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer tied to a Troop user.</p>
  <p>Investigating and preventing bad stuff from happening. We work hard to keep Troop secure and to prevent abuse and fraud.</p>
  <p>Communicating with you
  Solving your problems and responding to your requests. If you contact us with a problem or question, we will use your information to respond to that request and address your problems or concerns.</p>
  <p>In-product communications. We may use the information you provide to contact you through Troop using in-product messaging tools.</p>
  <p>SMS messages. We may send you service and administrative messages, such as when we notice that you are nearing a message or integration limit. We may also contact you to inform you about changes in our services, our service offerings and important service related notices, such as changes to this policy or security and fraud notices. These messages are considered part of the service and you may not opt-out of them. In addition, we sometimes send messages to Troop users about new product features or other news about Troop.</p>
  <p>Security</p>
  <p>Troop takes reasonable steps to protect information you provide to us as part of your use of the Troop service from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure. These steps take into account the sensitivity of the information we collect, process and store and the current state of technology. When you enter sensitive information (such as sign-in credentials) we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no electronic or email transmission or digital storage mechanism is ever fully secure or error free.</p>
  <p>Children’s information</p>
  <p>Troop is not directed to children under 13. If you learn that a minor child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us.</p>
